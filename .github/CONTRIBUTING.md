### 1. Create a new branch
Before making changes, create a new branch based on the dev branch:

git checkout -b <your-branch-name> 
```
Replace <your-branch-name> with a descriptive name for your branch, such as feature/add-note.

 ### üåø Branch Naming Convention
  Please use the following branch naming conventions:
 
  - `feature/`: For new features (e.g., `feature/add-login-page`)

  - `hotfix/`: For critical fixes in production (e.g., `hotfix/critical-bug`)
  - `chore/`: For maintenance tasks (e.g., `chore/update-dependencies`)
  - `docs/`: For documentation updates (e.g., `docs/update-readme`)
 
### 2. Make your changes
Make the necessary changes to the codebase. This could involve adding new features, fixing bugs, or improving documentation.

### 3. Commit your changes
Once you've made your changes, commit them with a clear and descriptive commit message. Follow the Conventional Commits style for your commit messages.
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add ability to edit notes"
```
### üìù Commit Message Guidelines
Use **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)** for all commit messages.
